# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Junying Ma, an M.Phil. student in [Financial Technology](https://soch.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/ftec/) at the Society Hub of [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Guang ZHANG](https://sites.google.com/view/guang-zhang/home). I got my B.Sc. degree in Economics from [IESR](https://iesr.jnu.edu.cn/) of [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Zizhong YAN](https://iesr.jnu.edu.cn/2019/0813/c17118a400509/page.psp). 

My research interests are to empower social sciences (economics) with machine learning and AI tools, to empirically understand urbans, environments, and human behavior. I aim to build bridges between empirical research and multimodal data.

<p style="color: #FA8072;">Currently I am applying for Ph.D. Programs, if you are looking for a Ph.D. student and are interested in me, please feel free to contact me. Any research collaboration in my research fields is also welcome. Thank you!</p>
